An example of exact diagonalization method for the 1D transverse field Ising model using Python, including calculating

- Energy
- ```lnZ```, where ```Z``` is the partition function
- Spin-spin correlation

This program presents a very brutal way for exact diagonalization, without considering any symmetry, therefore it is simple.
